## Navigation Tree ##

We want to know what our app user actually needs and wants to see, therefore we need to define the navigation tree.

Our menu consists of 2 layers of menu

1. Layer: Main menus as side drawer
2. Layer: Tabs 

When the users clicks on one menu in the 1. Layer menu. the assosiated Submenu (as tabs) will be shown

In each tab we put our content (e.g. a list of nearest buildings)
